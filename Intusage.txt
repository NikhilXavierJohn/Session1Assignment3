two examples of data that cannot be stored in a variable of type int :
Float and String.
ex :

public class Inttype{

	public static void Inttype(){
		int a;
		a = 4; // possible
	      //a = "elephant"; not possible since a is an integer and "elephant" is a string.
	      //a =  546.554 ; not possible since a is an integer and 546.554 is a float type.
		System.out.println(a);
	}
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Inttype();
	}
}
